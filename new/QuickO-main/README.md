## 1. What is QuickO
QuickO is a Java-based Android application that was created using the Android Studio platform. It utilises serpAPI and firebase. With this application, you may conduct fast searches without having to type anything or using your microphone. App will provide you the features of searching through your device camera only.

## 2. How it works?
QuickO offers users two facilities. The first one uses serpAPI primarily for direct image search. The second is text extraction from an image taken using a device's camera. The user has the choice to direct search for an image or to extract an image from a taken image.

**1. Welcome Page of the app :** <br>
This is how the app's welcome page looks. It includes the application's name, a brief description, and a logo image. There are three buttons on the home page namely 'Take Snap', 'Get Search Result', 'Use Text Extraction'.

**2. Feature-1 : Direct Search** <br>
Direct search utilising the camera on the user's device is the first feature offered by this app. To do this, all the user needs to do is click the 'Take Snap' button at the very top of the button list. A camera window will then emerge, allowing the user to take a photo of the thing they are looking for. After taking the picture, the user must click "Get Search Results" to view the search results for the object he just snapped. The bottom of the window will display the search results with a horizontal scrolling option.

**3. Feature-2 : Text Extraction** <br>
The app's text extraction capability, which uses optical character recognition, is its second feature. The user must select the "Use Text Extraction" button to access this feature, which will take him to a new window with two more buttons labelled "Take Snap" and "Extract text and copy to clipboard". After snapping a picture of the text, the user must click the extract text button to get the text out of the picture. The text is then copied to the device's clipboard so that it may be pasted wherever the user likes.<br>
Note: Whether you snap a photograph in portrait or standard mode has no bearing on the app's performance.
